# solar-monitor
An iOS app that can show real-time stats for an Outback with AXS Port or a Schneider with Combox system.

NOTE: This app will only run correctly if you have an Outback solar system with an AXS Port and/or a Schneider Electric Conext solar system with a Combox.

It communicates with the AXS Port or Combox using MODBUS over TCP/IP and is currently a work in progress. It displays all the information in a textual format but will be replaced with a more graphical look in future versions.

The Brultech portion is not complete or functional yet, more work needs to be done so it can show channels available from a Brultech GEM energy monitor.
